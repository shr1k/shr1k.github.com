Just a quick post to make a collective note of some of the few graphing libraries I am attempting to try out over the coming weeks. Base frameworks like D3.js and Raphael.js appear great, but might just be involve too much work if all I want to do is throw together a quick few visualisations.

**[dc.js](http://nickqizhu.github.io/dc.js/)**: A multi-dimensional charting library built to work natively with crossfilter and rendered using D3.js.

**[NVD3](https://github.com/novus/nvd3)**: Re-usable charts and chart components for D3.js.

**[Polychart2.js](https://github.com/polychart/polychart2)**: Graphing library that takes many ideas from the Grammar of Graphics and the R library ggplot2, and adds interactive elements for usage on the Web.

**[Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/download)**: Interactive charting library supporting many, MANY types of visualisation!

**[Chart.js](https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js)**: Simple HTML5 Charts using the canvas element. Currently doesn't support interactivity, but looks great.

**[Flot](http://www.flotcharts.org/)**: Plotting library for jQuery, with a focus on simple usage, attractive looks and interactive features.

**[Rickshaw](http://code.shutterstock.com/rickshaw/)**: JS toolkit for creating interactive time series graphs.

**[YUI Charts](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/charts/)**: A charting module based on the YUI library.

**[xCharts](http://tenxer.github.io/xcharts/)**: Yet another D3.js based library. Some of the examples don't appear to work currently.

**[Flotr2](https://github.com/HumbleSoftware/Flotr2)**: A fork of Flotr which removes the dependency on Prototype and a few enhancements.

Now it may turn out that most of these end up going unused, but hopefully that means I would have found the best fit library and will stick with it!
