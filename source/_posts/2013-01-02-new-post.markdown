This is a test post.

Sometimes I run `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` without asking anyone.

And then all I see is some damn code like so:

``` ruby Try out some R code http://www.r-bloggers.com/maps-in-r-plotting-data-points-on-a-map/ Stolen from here
> airports <- read.csv("http://openflights.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/openflights/openflights/data/airports.dat", header = FALSE)
> colnames(airports) <- c("ID", "name", "city", "country", "IATA_FAA", "ICAO", "lat", "lon", "altitude", "timezone", "DST")
> head(airports)
```
