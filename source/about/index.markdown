I'm [Shrikant](https://about.me/shrik), variously known as `shrikant`, `shrik` and `shr1k` around the web, subject to availability. I live in London, UK and [work in data warehousing, business intelligence and analytics](http://uk.linkedin.com/in/shrikantn/).

Playing with tech is fun -- I charitably refer to myself as [a hacker](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#what_is).

You can catch me lounging about on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/shr1k), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shrikant), or occasionally, in times of dire need, on [Google+](http://gplus.to/shrik). If you're not a social media sort of person and would like to get in touch to vent/complain/hire/chat/heckle, why don't you [drop me a line the old-fashioned way](http://scr.im/shr1k)?
